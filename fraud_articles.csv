Ex-CEO of failed Oklahoma bank indicted on fraud charges,"Danny Seibel issued fake loans to friends and neighbors and “frequently” altered First National Bank of Lindsay records to hide the activity from the OCC and the bank’s board, the DOJ alleged.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/failed-oklahoma-bank-ceo-seibel-indicted-fraud-charges-doj-occ/807158/,,fraud,True,"The Office of the Comptroller of the Currencyclosed First National Bank of Lindsayin October 2024; it was the second bank failure of 2024. Duncan, Oklahoma-based First Bank & Trust Co. acquired the shuttered bank’s insured deposits. The OCC closed$107.8 million-assetFirst National Bank of Lindsay after “identifying false and deceptive bank records and other information suggesting fraud that revealed depletion of the bank’s capital.” The regulator found the lender was in “an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business.” When the single-branch bank was closed, the OCC referred the case to the Justice Department. Seibel had been employed at the bank since 1993. During his time at the helm of the bank, Seibel also held other management roles, including CFO, information technology officer, compliance officer and Bank Secrecy Act officer, according tothe indictment. He was also a loan officer and served on the bank’s board and its executive loan committee. Some of the borrowers Seibel issued loans to were unaware he wasn’t recording their loans, was posting fake loans to their accounts, or inputting fake entries into bank records regarding their loans and accounts, the indictment said. Others, however, were aware of his tactics, and texted Seibel “asking him to ‘fix’ or add funds to their overdrawn accounts by manually adding [bank] funds to their accounts when they needed money,” the indictment alleged. One borrower, in October 2023, texted Seibel to ask him to add more money to his trucking company's checking account to cover operating expenses. “Seibel replied, ‘Dude[,] I just covered $70k and now you're $31k over. I'll give you $5k now and that is all[,] you gotta start putting money in,’” the indictment said. Five months later, the same borrower sought more money from Seibel, who replied, “‘You bring me deposits tomorrow. I am finally totally tapped. Way too far OD. You need to go factor and cover this overdraft . . . . Hey I'm over $500k. I'm tired of taking care of your business and get no damn deposits. I have legal lending limits and overdrafts are part of it. I'm sorry my job ain't worth it.’” But later that month, Seibel manually added more than $500,000 to that borrower’s account, which had a negative balance, “when no such deposit had actually been made,” according to the indictment. Some loans were issued under the guise of real estate or equipment purchasing, when they were actually used to repay other loans, gamble or pay day-to-day expenses, the DOJ alleged. In modifying bank reports, Seibel allegedly used new loans or transfers of the bank’s own funds to cover overdrafts of outstanding loans, according to the DOJ. The former CEO “frequently manipulated” bank records to hide the activity from the OCC and the bank’s board, the indictment alleged. At board meetings, “Seibel failed to disclose the true extent of borrowers' overdrafts or past-due loans, grossly misstating the amount of loans that FNBL had issued and failed to collect – due to borrower non-payment – by millions of dollars,” the indictment said. In August 2024, when the OCC was conducting a regularly scheduled on-site bank examination, Seibelallegedly provided agency staff with a false document that concealed “hundreds of changes” Seibel had made to loan data, the DOJ said. But a “suspiciously high volume of activity” reflected in the document led OCC examiners to ask for a daily maintenance report from June, the indictment said. After learning the OCC had obtained an unaltered copy of that report, Seibel “texted another Bank employee, ‘I think I'm nailed to the wall now I [g]ave them a report that [is not] the same as what they got now and they have both. Nobody's fault but my own. Also, delete these texts.’” Seibel also failed to implement an anti-money laundering program at the bank and advised bank customers to keep cash deposits below $10,000 to avoid triggering relevant reporting requirements, the DOJ alleged. If convicted, Seibel faces up to 30 years in prison and up to $1 million in fines, the DOJ said. The case was filed inU.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma."

"TD illegally targeted, fired Chinese-heritage employees: lawsuit",Employees allege TD “intentionally targeted and disproportionately impacted the bank’s Chinese and Chinese American employees” in the wake of its AML scandal.,https://www.bankingdive.com/news/td-illegally-targeted-fired-chinese-heritage-employees-lawsuit/806066/,,aml,True,"Five former TD Bank employees of Chinese heritage say the bank illegally fired them in the wake of TD’s fentanyl-tied money laundering scandal,court documents show. Plaintiffs Andrew Wong, Ka Po Wong, Anne Louie, April Ng and Millie Su allege that TD “intentionally targeted and disproportionately impacted the bank’s Chinese and Chinese American employees” to placate investigators as they probed the lender’santi-money laundering control issues, and to “give the appearance of robust AML procedures.” The bank’s “robust enforcement” went “far beyond the normal scope” in investigating the employees’ personal transaction histories, particularly cash exchanges that moved through their bank accounts, the plaintiffs said. Chinese families traditionally borrow money from family and friends, rather than banks, and it’s common for family members to gift funds for large purchases, such as a house, plaintiffs said, citing a “financial culture [that] is prevalent in the Chinese diaspora, including the Chinese-American community.” The investigators did not take that into account, the plaintiffs asserted. In one instance, investigators pressed Ng on a $500 transaction in new bills meant as a gift during Chinese New Year, a custom. In another, investigators questioned Su about $15,000 in cash she received from family members. The funds, intended as a house down payment gift to a family associate, were deposited into Su’s account. She added $5,000 from her account, and wrote the associate a $20,000 check. “The targeted Chinese and Chinese American employees provided proof that transactions questioned by TD were legitimate, yet each still suffered the most severe adverse employment action possible. They were terminated,” plaintiffs allege. “More callously, the terminated Chinese and Chinese American were demarketed from TD Bank. TD closed their personal and business accounts, and, upon information and belief, barred them from banking with TD in the future.” Prior to the fentanyl-tied AML investigation, TD “leveraged the national origin of its Chinese and Chinese American employees to foster trust in the Chinese community and build their business,” plaintiffs said. During the investigation, however, TD’s Chinese and Chinese American employees “were then targeted by the bank because of their ethnicity and national origin. They were punished for crimes committed by other Chinese individuals — crimes they were not involved in by individuals they did not know.” “Their Chinese heritage, once used by TD Bank to garner trust in the Chinese community, now became a target for TD,” plaintiffs said. Due to TD’s investigations of its Chinese and Chinese American employees in the New York City’s Chinatown branches alone, at least 22 employees were terminated or subject to adverse employment actions, the lawsuit asserted. All but one of the terminated employees were of Chinese origin. At least one employee was terminated for a transaction with a Chinese American employee, according to court documents. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement at their respective jobs, back pay and emotional damages sustained as a result of TD’s conduct. A TD spokesperson told Banking Dive that the bank has no comment, given that the litigation is pending. Arthur Schwartz, an attorney for the plaintiffs, did not respond to a request for comment."

Coinbase fined $24.8M by Irish central bank,"The crypto firm found three coding errors in its transaction monitoring system, but that meant the company insufficiently monitored 30 million transfers for AML, fraud and child sex exploitation, the central bank said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/coinbase-ireland-24-million-penalty-transaction-monitoring-aml-fraud/805260/,,"fraud, aml",True,"Coinbase agreed last week topay nearly €21.5 million($24.8 million) to the Central Bank of Ireland to settle allegations that the crypto firm’s Dublin-based subsidiary insufficiently monitored transactions between April 2021 and March of this year, with respect to anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing rules. Coinbase’s transaction monitoring system, at the time, used 21 scenarios to flag suspicious transactions or patterns, the companysaid in a blog postThursday. But when building the system, Coinbase inadvertently made three coding errors that caused five of the scenarios to fail to fully screen all transactions in 2021 and 2022. For example, Coinbase’s programming overlooked crypto wallet addresses containing special characters such as &. That meant, however, that more than 30 million transactions over a 12-month period – worth more than €176 billion – had not been properly monitored, the central bank said. Coinbase subsequently filed 2,708 suspicious transaction reports from the time frame, flagging suspicions associated with money laundering, fraud, scams, drug trafficking, cyberattacks and child sexual exploitation, the central bank said. “Crypto has particular technological features which, together with its anonymity-enhancing capabilities and cross-border nature, makes it especially attractive to criminals looking to move their funds,” Colm Kincaid, the central bank’s deputy governor for consumer and investor protection, said in a statement Thursday. “This is why it is especially important that firms engaged in crypto services have robust controls in place to identify and report suspicious transactions.” It is unclear, though, whether any of the transactions resulted in criminal activity, Coinbase noted. Coinbase identified the coding errors when testing its compliance systems and fixed them within two to three weeks after detection, the company said. The central bank reduced Coinbase’s initial €30,663,906 penalty by 30%, to €21,464,734. Coinbase, for its part, enhanced the testing and monitoring of its transaction monitoring system scenariosto prevent similar errors from happening again, the company said. But its European subsidiary is also leaving Ireland at the end of the year. The central bank said Coinbase intended to transfer the business of Coinbase Europe to a group entity in Luxembourg. As part of the settlement, the central bank cited that Coinbase failed to “conduct additional monitoring in respect of 184,790 transactions.” Coinbase removed some customers involved in suspicious transactions but “the failure to fully and properly monitor those customers’ transactions in the first instance meant that they remained customers of Coinbase Europe with access to its services for longer than they should have,” the central bank said."
